# Oh-Hell-Bot
A program that plays Oh Hell. Used for COMP10001 2016 s1 Project 3

This was the winner of the cohort wide tournament involving over 400 students.
This algorithm won both the original and bonus tournament with a win rate of 70% and 77% respectively. 

It uses simulation to generate hands as opponents.
Then it simulates the game multiple times (hundreds) and finds the card that produces the most points for the player.
It then chooses this card to play.

Supposedly, it is called the Monte Carlo Simulation.
